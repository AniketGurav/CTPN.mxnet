# Connectionist Text Proposal Network in MXNet

## Introduction
A MXNet CTPN implementation mimic of eragonruan's [tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/eragonruan/text-detection-ctpn) with full feature. We use eragonruan's dataset for training and get nearly the same detection results as his.
